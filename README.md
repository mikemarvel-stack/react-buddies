A starter React app designed for a collaborative coding and learning environment. This project introduces:

- React Routing using `react-router-dom`
- `useRef`, `useState`, and `useEffect` hooks
- Controlled forms

- Styled with a Material 3-inspired look

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moringa-SDF-PT10/react-buddies.git
cd react-buddies
npm install
npm run dev
```
